			You are using GitHub Gardener's Free Tier

			I just built something way way cooler, it's called Stealth Mode

			It's just like this version, but with a private repository. That way you are literally undetectable

			It costs 5$/mo. This is the first time I am monetizing a project of mine. Feels strange, but I am doing it to achieve my dream of becoming an indie maker

			Make sure to find me and even DM me on Twitter @alexsideris_ or in the chatbox at githubgardener.xyz
