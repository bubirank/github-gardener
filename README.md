			You are using GitHub Gardener's Free Tier

			I just built something way, way cooler, it's called Stealth Mode

			It's just like this version, but with a private repository. Your GitHub turns green, your commits cannot be seen

			It costs 5$/mo

			Much love, Alex (@alexsideris_  githubgardener.xyz)
