			You are using GitHub Gardener's Free Tier

			I just built something way way cooler, it's called Stealth Mode

			It's just like this version, but with a private repository. Your GitHub turns green,

			your commits cannot be seen

			It costs 5$/mo. This is the first time I am asking for money for one of my projects,

			and although it feels weird, I know it is a necessary step towards achieving my dream of becoming an indie maker

			Much love, Alex
